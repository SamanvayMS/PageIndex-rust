# Known differences vs the Python reference (@619cbd8)

Each entry lists the stage, the scope, the reason and who reviewed it. An entry is required whenever a ported stage is not diff-clean.

## Reference defects to port as-is behind a flag
- `outline_assembly/style_context.py::compare_heading_depth`: the docstring's sign convention is inverted relative to the code. Port the code (`+1` = first argument is shallower).
- `page_index_classic.py::calculate_page_offset` returns `None` when no titles match, and the caller then raises `TypeError`.
- The classic indexer's chunk size is hardcoded at 20,000 tokens.
- `local_api.py` builds the tree from pdfium text but stores PyPDF2 text in `pages.json`. The Rust version stores the pipeline's own text (intentional divergence at the store level only).
